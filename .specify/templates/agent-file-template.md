# Author Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from feature plans. See `/memory/constitution.md` for governing
principles (Code Quality, Testing Standards, UX Consistency, Performance & Scalability).

**Last updated**: 2025-09-24

## Active Technologies

List technologies and versions actively used in the project (extracted from plan
documents). Maintainers MUST update this section when adding or removing major
technologies. Example format:

- Node.js 20 (if used)
- TypeScript 5.x
- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL 15

_(If this file is auto-generated, ensure the generator captures the top 3-5
technologies used project-wide and place details in the automated section.)_

## Project Structure

Provide a canonical project structure extracted from plans and feature docs. Keep
this short and update when major re-organization occurs. Example:

```
src/
tests/
docs/
```

## Commands

Include commonly used developer commands here (build, test, lint, local run).
Example:

- `npm run build`
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`

## Code Style

Document language-specific style and formatting choices (links to linters,
formatters, and style guides). CI MUST enforce these rules.

## Recent Changes

List the last 3 features / changes and what they added. Keep this section
informational (auto-generated where possible; manual edits allowed below).
