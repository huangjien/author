## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (prefer keeping heavy implementation details out of the spec)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, product owners, and developers

This spec aligns with the project's constitution: each Functional Requirement below
is mapped to one or more constitutional principles (Code Quality, Testing Standards,
User Experience Consistency, Performance & Scalability) in the requirement metadata.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: All sections in this document are mandatory for this feature.
- **Optional sections**: N/A for this feature — keep only relevant content.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a novel author using VS Code, I want in-editor AI-assisted writing suggestions,
visual diffs of suggested edits, and writing session tracking so I can iterate my
drafts faster and measure my progress.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a selected text range in an open markdown file, When the user requests
   suggestions, Then the system returns up to configured suggestions with
   confidence scores and displays them in the Suggestions Panel.

2. Given suggested edits applied in preview mode, When the user chooses "Preview
   Changes", Then visual diff decorations appear (insertions, deletions,
   modifications) and persist until cleared or replaced.

3. Given a writing session, When user types or invokes suggestions, Then the
   session tracker records activity, updates typing counts, and logs suggestion
   applications versus dismissals with timestamps.

### Edge Cases

- Empty selection / cursor-only requests: provide a completion based on nearby
  context or return a validation error if not allowed.
- Very large selections (>5000 chars): either truncate context or return an
  explicit validation error (per REQ-010 limits).
- Remote AI service unavailable: fall back to mock/local backend (REQ-006).
- Flaky suggestion model: surface confidence scores and avoid auto-applying
  suggestions; guard UI to prevent accidental destructive edits.

## Clarifications

### Session (2025-09-24)

The following targeted clarification questions were generated by the planning agent to resolve remaining ambiguities before planning and implementation. Please answer them here or in a follow-up message; answers will be recorded into this section.

1. Scope of AI edits: For `replacement` and `improvement` suggestion types, should the assistant prefer conservative edits that preserve author voice (default) or aggressive re-writing when high-confidence suggestions are available? Please specify default preference and whether a per-request override is allowed.

2. Privacy & local-only mode: When the user enables the local mock backend (offline mode), should telemetry and session export be fully disabled by default, or only suppressed but still available if the user explicitly opts in? (This affects REQ-006 and session export behavior REQ-039.)

3. Decoration persistence: For visual diffs (REQ-012..REQ-018), should decorations persist across editor sessions and restarts, or be ephemeral and cleared when the file is closed? Define expected default behavior.

4. Session ownership and multi-file sessions: Are writing sessions scoped to a single file/document or should they optionally span multiple files (project-level sessions)? If spanning is allowed, how should session IDs be associated with files for export and activity logs?

5. Performance targets: For requests to remote AI services, what is the acceptable latency SLO (e.g., p95 < 1.5s for small selections <500 chars)? Please provide target latency thresholds or indicate 'TBD' if unknown.
